<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Vector class is used to for ex. represent directions or movements.

A vector is represented by the following characteristics:

	• Its x magnitude
	• Its y magnitude
	• Its z magnitude
	• The w coordinate

Vector Class provides read only accessors for its four attributes.

It takes array as a parameter with one mandatory and one optional key:

- ’dest’: the vector’s destination vertex, mandatory.
-’orig’: the vector’s origin vertex, optional. 
By default 'orig' is set to instance of vertex with the x=0, y=0, z=0, w=1.

Multiple methods are present:

	- vector normalize() : returns a normalized version of the vector.

	- vector add( Vector $rhs ) : returns the sum vector of two
	vectors.

	- vector sub( Vector $rhs ) : returns the difference vector of
	both vectors.

	- vector div( $k ) : returns division of vector on value.

	- vector opposite() : returns the opposite vector.

	- vector scalarProduct( $k ) : returns the multiplication of the
	vector with a scalar.

	-float dotProduct( Vector $rhs ) : returns the scalar
	multiplication of both vectors.

	-float cos( Vector $rhs ) : returns the angle’sAppendix cosine
	between both vectors.

	-vector crossProduct( Vector $rhs ) : returns the cross
	multiplication of both vectors (right-hand mark!)
